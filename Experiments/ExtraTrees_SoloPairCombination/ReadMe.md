## Experiments 3: [Extra Trees] performance of model with up to two subsets of features
In this experiment, we find the performance of Extra Trees regressor model with up to two subsets of features.

To run this experiment, you can the run `2.py` as follows which will execute in multi-thread:
```
python 2.py
```

**Note:** To run this experiment you need the results from the [experiment 2](../ExtraTrees_allCombinationFeatures).
