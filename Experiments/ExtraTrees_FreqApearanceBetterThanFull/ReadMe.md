### Experiment 4: [Extra Trees] frequency of appearance in top models
In this experiment, we find the frequency of appearance of each feature group in Extra Trees regressor models which have better performance than full-feature setup.

To run this experiment, you can the run `main.py` as follows which will execute in multi-thread:
```
python main.py
```

**Note:** To run this experiment you need the results from the [experiment 2](../ExtraTrees_allCombinationFeatures).
